# minimal-conky
Requirements: Conky, Conky-colours, LM_Sensors



Why? 
Conky is a great tool. However the things people were doing with it were either way to simple or overly fancy.
This is just a basic tool for system monitoring with just the things you need. 

some sensors may need to be replaced depending on your specific system.
